This is repo for rttp tasks.

To run distributed application:
  - run each server (alpha and beta) using maven plugin with command `mvn exec:java`;
  - each server needs database, db conf later;
  - deploy Spring app on Tomcat.

After that next services would be available:
  - `/AlienNet/register` for registering new Alien(user) with `Ok` message in success case;
  - `/AlienNet/login/<name>/<password>` for authenticating, returns `Ok` or `Bad:(` messages;
  - `/AlienNet/search/<search-param>` with searching by name, displays found aliens.
